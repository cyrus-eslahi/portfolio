            I'm Cyrus — a builder, coder, and problem-solver who can't sit still. I make Roblox games, AI tools, electronics projects, apps, and anything else that pops into my head. If I don't know how to make something, I learn it on the spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm into robotics, 3D printing, investing, software engineering, and designing tech that feels way ahead of my age. I use tools like Visual Studio, OpenAI, Supabase, GitHub, and whatever else gets the job done. I love mixing hardware with AI, building small ideas that turn into huge projects, and pushing myself into stuff most people don't attempt until college.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always experimenting — new apps, new games, new systems, new businesses. Half my projects start as dumb ideas and end up becoming something real. That's the fun of it.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium">
            Still growing. Still learning. Still building.
